# Hash Table Presentation 
The purpose of this repository is to present the idea of the `hash table` data structure. In this repository, you will find the code that was used during our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NCLc6p19IvXvYeru1W8ws734RZow3zMATC_YVWODY2Q/edit#slide=id.p) which covers the following about hash tables: 

### 1. Motivation for using hash tables compared to a typical python list

### 2. Hash Functions

### 3. Collision Resolutions

## Why care about Hash Tables?

### 1. Leetcode: [Hash Table problems](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/)
